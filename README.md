## PokePromo Application

    PokePromo is a promotional mobile application for upcoming Pokemon games and the franchise alike. The application showcases a plethora of features from a trivia to a gacha system.

## Design Process

    The application is targetted at audiences who are curious about Pokemon and its upcoming releases. The targetted audience may vary widely in age as Pokemon has been around for about 25 years now. Pokemon fans from 25 years ago can still enjoy its newer releases, as well as newer fans born during the 21st century.

    User Stories:

        As a user looking for new Pokemon releases, I want to learn more about the game and its lore.
